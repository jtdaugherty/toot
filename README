This is a vty-ui-based twitter client.

Features for now:

  * Shows you a list of tweets from your timeline.
  * Refreshes once per minute.
  * Extremely likely to exceed twitter's API rate limit, as the limit is
    totally unreasonable.
  * Caches tweets on exit and loads the cache on startup.

To build:

  git clone https://github.com/jtdaugherty/toot.git
  git clone https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick.git
  cabal update
  cd toot
  cabal sandbox init
  cabal sandbox add-source ../brick
  cabal install -j

To run this program, you'll need a configuration file containing OAuth
credentials required to access your account from the client.  To get those
you'll need to create an "app" on dev.twitter.com.  Once you have the "API key"
and "API secret" for your app, put them into toot.cfg as follows:

  [consumer]
  oauth_consumer_key=<api key>
  oauth_consumer_secret=<api secret>

On the same page where your API credentials are listed, you'll also see a
section called "Your access token".  The token and token secret need to be in
the config as follows:

  [token]
  oauth_token=<token>
  oauth_token_secret=<token secret>
